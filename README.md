# Email-HTML-Buddy
Designed to help with mundane tasks at my job, namely building a boilerplate template based on the design for the day by inserting html code snippets with the proper images. 

It reads the image names and detects their dimensions from a specific folder. A template will be generated saving time to do more interesting things within the digital marketing realm.
